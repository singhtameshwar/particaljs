Particle.js is a JavaScript library for simulating particles in graphical environments. It provides functionality for creating and manipulating particles, as well as rendering them on a canvas or within a web page.

Features
Particle Creation: Easily create and customize particles with various properties such as size, color, velocity, and lifespan.
Particle Manipulation: Manipulate particles in real-time by applying forces, changing properties, or removing them from the simulation.
Rendering: Render particles efficiently on a canvas or integrate them seamlessly into a web page.
Interactivity: Enable user interaction by allowing particles to respond to mouse movements, clicks, or other events.
Customization: Customize the behavior and appearance of particles to suit different applications and artistic preferences.
